# About NYC Wellness on a Budget

## Our Mission

At NYC Wellness on a Budget, we believe that wellness should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation. Living in New York City can be expensive, but taking care of your health doesn't have to be.

## Our Story

Founded by a group of health-conscious New Yorkers, our platform was born out of frustration with the high cost of wellness services in the city. We discovered that there are countless affordable and free resources available, but they're often hard to find or not well-publicized.

## What We Do

We research, test, and share:

- **Free fitness classes** in parks and community centers
- **Affordable gym memberships** and fitness deals
- **Low-cost mental health resources** and support groups
- **Budget-friendly nutrition** tips and meal planning
- **Community wellness events** happening throughout the five boroughs

## Our Values

- **Accessibility**: Wellness should be available to everyone
- **Community**: We believe in supporting local businesses and community organizations
- **Transparency**: We're honest about costs and share both pros and cons
- **Inclusivity**: We celebrate diversity and work to make wellness welcoming for all
